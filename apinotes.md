Okay so what do i want to do

Search for a film
Save films that i've searched

As a user,
So that I can find films I'm interested in,
I need to be able to search for a film

As a user,
So that I can keep track of films that I like,
I need to be able to save films
(when the user searches for a film, there's an 'add rating' button next to it and they can press it, which
will add it to the postgres database)


for each hash in the array, I want to write the name
